# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Project Description

WTWR is a back-end project aimed at developing a server for the WTWR application. The server provides an API for managing user data and clothing items, enabling users to get clothing recommendations based on the weather. This project involves setting up a database, implementing user authentication and authorization, and deploying the server to a remote machine.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data and clothing items.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to interact with the database.
- **Nodemon**: A tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when file changes are detected.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
